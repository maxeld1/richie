        <p>My name is Richie. I am a composer, writer, and performer working across music, theatre, and film. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Music Composition and have formal training in harmony, counterpoint, orchestration, and vocal performance. I am a trained theatre performer and vocalist, with experience in both classical and contemporary styles. My work includes writing and composing original music, developing scripts and narrative-driven projects, and performing in theatrical and musical settings. I have collaborated on stage and screen projects in a variety of roles, including composer, writer, performer, and sound designer. My background in music composition informs my approach to storytelling, with an emphasis on structure, rhythm, and emotional clarity.</p>

      <h1 style="margin-top:70px;">Artist Manifesto.</h1>
      <div style="max-width:760px;">
        <p>Art is not a luxury. It is not decoration.</p>
        <p>It is not a product designed to distract us from living.</p>
        <p>Art is a human reflex. Before technique, before theory, before money or prestige, art existed as a response to being alive. Someone felt something they couldn’t carry alone, and they made a mark. A sound. A story. A movement. Art is what happens when a human being notices they are here—and refuses to let that fact go undocumented. Art does not descend from the heavens. It rises from kitchens, basements, classrooms, hospital rooms, and half-empty apartments. It comes from boredom, loneliness, joy, confusion, faith, doubt, jealousy, love, and shame. It comes from flawed people trying to make sense of their flaws. Life does not imitate art. Art imitates life—messy, unresolved, contradictory life. We reject the idea that art must be clean, perfect, aspirational, or morally tidy. Human beings are none of those things. We contradict ourselves. We want the wrong things. We hurt each other without meaning to. We mean well and fail anyway. Art that ignores this is not elevated—it is dishonest. Art is not meant to solve life. It is meant to reflect it. A mirror, not a manual. In art, we see ourselves at a distance. We recognize our own thoughts spoken by someone else’s mouth. Our own fears wearing someone else’s face. That recognition—oh, it’s not just me—is the quiet miracle of art. It does not fix us, but it makes us feel less alone while we remain broken. People are not subjects for art. People are the source of art. Without people, art is an empty gesture. Without lived experience, technique is hollow. Craft matters, discipline matters—but they are in service of something deeper: the human pulse underneath. The artist’s job is not to transcend humanity, but to dive into it without flinching. Art is an act of empathy, whether it is gentle or cruel, funny or devastating. Even satire is a form of care—it says this matters enough to examine. Comedy, tragedy, music, silence—all are different dialects of the same language: being human out loud. We believe art should pull back the curtain while still preserving the magic. That you can show the seams, the wires, the hands at work—and still leave the audience believing. Especially then. Art is not made by perfect people. It is made for imperfect ones. It is allowed to be uncomfortable. It is allowed to fail. It is allowed to ask questions without answering them. It is allowed to say “I don’t know” and mean it. To make art is to say: I was here. I felt this. Did you feel it too? And if someone answers—quietly, honestly, even years later—then the art has done its job. That is enough.</p>
